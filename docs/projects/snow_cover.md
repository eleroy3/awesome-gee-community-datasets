# Global MODIS-based snow cover monthly values (2000-2020)

The Global monthly snow cover repository contains multiple products (based on the MODIS/Terra MOD10A2), the description along with the [datasets can be found here](https://zenodo.org/record/5774954)

* Global snow cover monthly long-term (2000–2012) P90 and standard deviation derived from the ESA CCI snow cover weekly product;
* Global snow cover monthly values P05, P50 and P95 for the period 2000–2020 derived using ESA snow cover fraction daily 1-km values;
* Min and max geometric temperatures for the mid-month;

Quantiles (probability either 0.05, 0.5, 0.9 and/or 0.95) have been derived by matching dates in the filenames (daily or weekly values). After deriving quantiles, gaps were filled using temporal neighbors (e.g. missing values for year 2002 were filled using average of values between year 2001 and 2003). The gaps were especially large for months of November, December, January and February, northern Hemisphere. Important note: maps still contain some artifacts due to high reflections of white-sands e.g. Salar de Uyuni desert in Bolivia and similar. Processing steps are available here. Antarctica is not included.

File naming convention:
* clm = theme: climate,
* snow.cover = variable: snow cover fractions,
* esa.modis = data source ESA snow product,
* p.90 = upper 90% quantile,
* 1km = spatial resolution / block support: 1 km,
* s0..0cm = vertical reference: land surface,
* 2000_2012 = time reference aggregated: from 2000 to 2012
