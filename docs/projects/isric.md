# Soil Grids 250m v2.0

SoilGrids is designed as a globally consistent, data-driven system that predicts soil properties and classes using global covariates and globally fitted models. If you are looking for soil information on national and/or local levels we advise to compare SoilGrids predictions with soil maps derived from national and local soil geographical databases. National soil maps are usually based on more detailed input soil information and therefore are often more accurate than SoilGrids (within the local coverage area). For an overview of national and regional soil databases, please refer to the Soil Geographic Databases compendium. The ‘mean’ and ‘median (0.5 quantile)’ may both be used as predictions of the soil property for a given cell. The mean represents the ‘expected value’ and provides an unbiased prediction of the soil property.
