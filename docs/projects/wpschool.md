# Gridded Sex-Disaggregated School-Age Population (2020)

Following the IIEP-UNESCO methodology for reconstructing georeferenced school-age populations (ISCED 1 to 3) by year and sex, these datasets were produced by WorldPop (University of Southampton) by applying the Sprague Multipliers to 30-arcsecond (approximately 1km at the equator) gridded datasets depicting the estimated spatial distribution of sex-disaggregated 5-year age groups. These datasets include the sex disaggregated school age population for countries and Dependent territories in Africa only.
