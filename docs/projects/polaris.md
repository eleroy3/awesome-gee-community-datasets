# Polaris 30m Probabilistic Soil Properties US
Probabilistic Remapping of SSURGO (POLARIS) soil properties—a database of 30-m probabilistic soil property maps over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The mapped variables over CONUS include soil texture, organic matter, pH, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Brooks-Corey and Van Genuchten water retention curve parameters, bulk density, and saturated water content.

#### Source Data Structure
POLARIS provides a spatially continuous, internally consistent, quantitative prediction of soil series. It offers potential solutions to the primary weaknesses in SSURGO: 1) unmapped areas are gap-filled using survey data from the surrounding regions, 2) the artificial discontinuities at political boundaries are removed, and 3) the use of high resolution environmental covariate data leads to a spatial disaggregation of the coarse polygons.

The dataset is available at varying depth from surface, while the statistics provided include mean, mode , median and percentile values, only median values have been included as part of the collection created.

|Depth from Surface|
|:----------------:|
|0-5 cm            |
|5-15 cm           |
|15-30 cm          |
|30-60 cm          |
|60-100 cm         |
|100-200 cm        |

Overall datasets include processing approximately 80,000 files which have been converted into individual images within a collection per property at varying depth. So for example collection bd_mean includes bd_0_5 and represents a single image for contiguous US with bd value at surface depth of 0-5 cm from surface.

##### Notes from Data providers
* 05/01/2019 - The variables hb, alpha, ksat, om are in log10 space.

* 05/01/2019 - Due to file size constraints, the 1 arcsec database is split into 1x1 degree tiffs. Each variable/layer/statistic has its own virtual raster that acts as the "glue" of all the smaller 1x1 degree chunks. For more information on virtual rasters see https://www.gdal.org/gdal_vrttut.html.

* 06/02/2019 - The variables hb and alpha were originally reported to have the units of log10(cm) and log10(cm-1) respectively. This was a typo. The correct units are log10(kPa) and log10(kPa-1) respectively.
