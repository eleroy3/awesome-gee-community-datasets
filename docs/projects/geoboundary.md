# geoBoundaries Global Database of Political Administrative Boundaries

Produced and maintained by the William & Mary [geoLab](http://geolab.wm.edu/) since 2017, the geoBoundaries Global Database of Political Administrative Boundaries Database is an online, open license resource of boundaries (i.e., state, county) for every country in the world. We currently track 199 total entities, including all 195 UN member states, Greenland, Taiwan, Niue, and Kosovo. All boundaries are available to view or download in common file formats, including shapefiles; the only requirement for use is [acknowledgement](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#citation). The most up-to-date information about geoBoundaries can be found at www.geoboundaries.org.

All boundary types have been ingested and are include the following with Admin level varying from 0-4 which have been ingested.

_HPSCU_  - High Precision Single Country Unstandardized. The premier geoBoundaries release, representing the highest precision files available for every country in the world. No standardization is performed on these files, so (for example) two countries may overlap in the case of contested boundaries.

_HPSCGS_  - High Precision Single Country Globally Standardized. A version of geoBoundaries high precision data that has been clipped to the U.S. Department of State boundary file, ensuring no contested boundaries or overlap in the dataset. This globally standardized product may have gaps between countries. If you need a product with no gaps, we recommend our simplified global product.

_SSCU_  - Simplified Single Country Unstandardized. A simplified version of every file available for every country in the world. No standardization is performed on these files, so (for example) two countries may overlap in the case of contested boundaries.

_SSCGS_  - Simplified Single Country Globally Standardized. A version of geoBoundaries simplified data that has been clipped to the U.S. Department of State boundary file, ensuring no contested boundaries or overlap in the dataset. This globally standardized product may have gaps between countries.

_CGAZ_  - Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones. A global composite of the SSCGS ADM0, ADM1 and ADM2, with gaps filled between borders.  Also available at higher levels of simplification.

#### Data Preprocessing for GEE
To make the datasets more amenable they were downloaded using the API and all features in a folder were then merged into single collections pertaining to varying boundary type and admin levels. There might be some missing pieces owing to issues with downloads and or upload to GEE but care has been taken to minimize those efforts.
