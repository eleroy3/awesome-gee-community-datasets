# Gridded Global GDP and HDI (1990-2015)

Two global key indicators of development are Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI). While ‘GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services—that is, those that are bought by the final user—produced in a [given area] in a given period of time, HDI is a composite index of ‘average achievement in key dimensions of human development:

* a long and healthy life,
* being knowledgeable and
* have a decent standard of living’30.

Gap-filled multiannual datasets in gridded form for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI). To provide a consistent product over time and space, the sub-national data were only used indirectly, scaling the reported national value and thus, remaining representative of the official statistics. This resulted in annual gridded datasets for GDP per capita (PPP), total GDP (PPP), and HDI, for the whole world at 5 arc-min resolution for the 25-year period of 1990–2015. Additionally, total GDP (PPP) is provided with 30 arc-sec resolution for three time steps (1990, 2000, 2015).

Dataset notes:

* Units for GDP is US dollar

* Pedigree GDP:  Pedigree index numbers, coded as follows: 1-regional reported; 2-regional interpolated; 3-regional extrapolated; 5-national reported; 6-national interpolated; 7-national extrapolated

* Pedigree HDI: Pedigree index numbers, coded as follows: 1-regional reported; 2-regional scaled; 4-national reported; 5-national interpolated; 6-national extrapolated; 7-no data, regional average used
