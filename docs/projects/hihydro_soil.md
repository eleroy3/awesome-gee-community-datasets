#  HiHydroSoil v2.0 layers

**In May 2020, ISRIC has released the latest version (v2.0) of its Soilgrids250m product. This release has made it possible for [FutureWater](https://www.futurewater.eu) to update its HiHydroSoil v1.2 database with newer, more precise and with a higher resolution soil data, which resulted in the development and release of HiHydroSoil v2.0.**

Soil information is the basis for all environmental studies. Since local soil maps of good quality are often not available, global soil maps with a low resolution are used. Furthermore, soil maps do not include information about soil hydraulic properties, which are of importance in, for example, hydrological modeling, erosion assessment and crop yield modelling. HiHydroSoil v2.0 can fill this data gap. HiHydroSoil v2.0 includes the following data and additional information along with links to download the data can be [found here](https://www.futurewater.eu/projects/hihydrosoil/)

* Organic Matter Content
* Soil Texture Class
* Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity
* Mualem van Genuchten parameters Alpha and N
* Saturated Water Content
* Residual Water Content
* Water content at pF2, pF3 and pF4.2
* Hydrologic Soil Group (USDA)

The Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) determines the Runoff Curve Number which is often used in hydrological modelling to estimate the direct runoff from rainfall. Four hydrologic soil groups and three dual hydrologic soil groups. The data layers originally consisting of float data type were multiplied by a factor of 10,000 and subsequently converted to integer type. It is therefore required to translate the data to the proper units by multiplying with 0.0001.
