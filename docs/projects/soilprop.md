# Soil Properties 800m

The data shown here were obtained by aggregating current USDA-NCSS soil survey data (SSURGO back-filled with STATSGO where SSURGO is not available) within 800mÂ² grid cells. This data aggregation technique results in maps that may not match the original data at any given point, and is intended to depict regional trends in soil properties at the statewide scale.

This app was developed by the California Soil Resource Lab at UC Davis and UC-ANR in collaboration with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.

#### Preprocessing
For layers with depth profiles a _profile collection is created with a min_depth and max_depth property,this can then be used for filtering an allows the varying profiles to stay in single image collection for a single property like sand and sand_profile for example.

You can [download the data layers here](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soil-properties/download.php) along with lookup tables for layers that are categorical instead of continuous. Also mode pyramding policy is applied to all categorical layers and you can find the lookup table for all categorical variable in the download page.

##### Soil Texture Palette
Palettes have been created for variable types and a palette for Soil Texture is included below. Some palettes include rgb values and can be converted in hex codes for each variable type. These can be extraced from the app page and a few are included in the sample code.
