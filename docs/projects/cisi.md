# Harmonized Global Critical infrastructure & Index (CISI)

Critical infrastructure (CI) is fundamental for the functioning of a society and forms the backbone for socio-economic development. Natural and human-made threats, however, pose a major risk to CI. Therefore, geospatial data on the location of CI are fundamental for in-depth risk analyses, which are required to inform policy decisions aiming to reduce risk. We present a first-of-its-kind globally harmonized spatial dataset for the representation of CI.

In this study the users generated: (1) a harmonized detailed geospatial data of the worldâ€™s main CI systems into a single geospatial database; and (2) a Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) to express the global spatial intensity of CI. The datasets are generated from Open Streetmap extract from 8th January 2021 using https://planet.openstreetmap.org/. You can read the [full paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01218-4). You can download the spatial extracts for both the feature type and the Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4957647#.Yl5lhFzMJct)
