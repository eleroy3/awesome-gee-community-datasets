# Global Soil Salinity Maps (1986-2016)

This dataset includes global soil salinity layers for the years 1986, 1992, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2016. The maps were generated with a random forest classifier that was trained using seven soil properties maps, thermal infrared imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. The validation accuracy of the resulting maps was in the range of 67â€“70%. The total area of salt affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear increasing trend. Further details are provided in a peer-reviewed journal article (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111260).
